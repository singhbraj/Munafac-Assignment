Mean of an array = (sum of all elements) / (number of elements)

The median of a sorted array of size N is defined as the middle element when N is odd and the average of the middle two parts when N is even. Since the collection is not sorted here, we sort the array first, then apply the above formula.


Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in an array. For example, [6, 3, 9, 6, 6, 5, 9, 3] the Mode is 6, as it occurs most often.


Note : Mode can have multiple in an array so I just pick the first one.
